# Background:
In the lead up to the holiday season of 2015, John a retailer of luxury jewelry items was wondering what he could do differently to increase sales in a cost efficient manner. He had tried the traditional routes of Google AdWords, flyers etc. but he was not able to get the word out to a net new audience.

Fortunately, at a professional networking event, John met Arvind Singh the founder of www.intentaware.com.  Arvind had seen first hand, how business owners that were not data or digital savvy were struggling in the new marketing age. To address that demand he built an analytics solution that:
A.	Identified web traffic by full postal code, which most web analytics packages do not do
B.	Overlaid US and Canadian census data on web site visitors at an anonymous level
C.	Generated ads in real time that served creative from a  library of options creative based on key attributes identified by the official census data
In Arvind's words, "To me this was the democratization of the web for those merchants that like to see their customer in the eye and shake their hand". John was quick to see the potential. "I had heard of these fancy technologies and of course experienced myself of being followed around the web by ads, but this seemed to be a better solution".
# Implementation:
Arvind tagged John's website with a proprietary script from IntentAware. Suddenly there was context around each IP address. The ability to see income levels, home ownership, educational level etc. helped personalize the experience of each visitor. After a 60 day period, there was enough data to analyze from a statistical point of view. None of the other major web analytical packages offer this functionality.
Insight:
John had tried "look alike audiences" and other such features from some ad tech providers in the past but did not have much success.  But the folks at IntentAware gave a new dimension to the results. They pinpointed a single, specific postal code that was outperforming the others.

# Why is a postal code Important?
In Canada, the last 3 digits of the 6 character alpha numeric postal code represents a Local Delivery Unit (LDU). The larger the city, the more specific the LDU. In John's case, the LDU represented one of the affluent postal codes in the city of Toronto.

The results were mapped using a Google maps API and the finding was obvious.  "At that moment, I knew", says John, "I had found the area I wanted to target".
Implementation
With John not being able to target by a 6 letter postal code precision on Google or on Facebook, he turned to Canada Post's Smart Mail program. This program allows merchants to send a physical mail to Canadians by their postal code.

# Results
For just a few hundred dollars, John was able to target this postal code just ahead of the 2015 holiday season. "Targeting the postal code with Smart Mail has been one of the best marketing programs I have used. And if it was not for IntentAware, I would not have been able to translate the online insight into an offline marketing tactic".  I was able to get a 6X return on that investment with the Canada Post Smart Mail program.
